Project: "Clustering Project for customer online retail"
Name: "Hamed Ahmed Hamed Ahmed"
StudentId: "454827"

Problem Statement: 
"A Company wants to increase their annual profit by selecting suitable customers
  who had better transactions and got good Revenue"

Dataset:
"Online retail is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions
 occurring between **01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011** for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.
 The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers."
'

'so We are going to analysis the Customers based on below 3 factors:'
'R (Recency): Number of days since last purchase'
'F (Frequency): Number of tracsactions'
'M (Monetary): Total amount of transactions (revenue contributed)'

Let\'s discuss each of the customer segments in more detail:
  
1- Highly Engaged and Valuable Customers (Cluster 1)
This segment is comprised of customers who have recently made many purchases and with high monetary value.
These customers are highly engaged with the brand and are likely to continue making purchases in the future.
Businesses should focus on retaining these customers and maintaining their loyalty. This can be achieved through personalized promotions, exclusive offers, and by providing excellent customer service.
Consider implementing a loyalty program or VIP program for this segment to further incentivize repeat purchases.
This segment is a prime target for upselling and cross-selling opportunities. Offer these customers complementary products or services to enhance their experience with your brand.

2- Less Engaged and Moderate Purchasing Power Customers (Cluster 2)
This segment is comprised of customers who have a moderate level of recent purchases and monetary value.
These customers may be less engaged with the brand and may not be making purchases as frequently as the first cluster.
To increase engagement and drive repeat purchases, businesses should focus on providing targeted and relevant promotions, offers, and advertisements.
Consider gathering more information on these customers, such as their preferences and purchasing history, to create a more personalized experience.
This segment may also be open to trying new products or services, so businesses can use this as an opportunity to introduce new offerings and expand their customer base.

3- Less Engaged and Less Valuable Customers (Cluster 3)
This segment is comprised of customers who have made few purchases in recent times and with low monetary value.
These customers are less engaged and are not as valuable to the business as the other two clusters.
To increase engagement and drive repeat purchases, businesses can offer special promotions or discounts to this segment.
Consider gathering more information on these customers to determine what may be causing their lack of engagement and address any pain points.
This segment may also be a good target for re-engagement campaigns, such as sending a follow-up email or a special offer to encourage them to make a purchase.

By understanding and targeting each customer segment based on their 
recency, frequency, and monetary value, businesses can improve customer engagement and retention,
and optimize their spending on customer acquisition and retention.
